# DominantColor
* This project aims to find dominant color in picture via opencv with python lang. 👊🏻
* To be able to find dominant color i've used k means clustering instead of try to find histogram for each pixel.💅🏻
* In dominant_color.py i've just used numpy and sklearn libraries for both histogram and K Means.
* I didn't use library wrote KMeans and Histogram codes by manually instead in dominant_color_man.py🏋🏻‍♀️
